## Important

Overview
This software may be incorrectly flagged by Windows Defender, VirusTotal, or other antivirus programs due to its behavior. It requests certain network-related information, including:

IP Address,

MAC Address,

DNS Server Information,

These requests are often used for legitimate purposes, such as improving network functionality or troubleshooting. However, because these actions can resemble those typically associated with malware or unauthorized software, they may trigger a false positive in antivirus scans.

## Why It Happens
Antivirus software uses patterns and heuristics to identify potential threats. Since some malicious software also requests similar information to perform harmful actions, any software that does the same may be mistakenly categorized as a virus or malware. This is a known issue that can occur with many legitimate programs that interact with network configurations or systems.

## Assurances
Please be assured that this software is completely safe to use and does not have any malicious intent. I respect user privacy and only request this information for necessary, harmless purposes related to the functionality of the executable which is networking or troubleshooting issues on your machine.
